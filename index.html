          <h3>Senior Solutions Architect </h3>
          <p>
            Hello , my name is Nitin Rohidas and welcome to my website !!

            I’m a techie who’s passionate about open source software, cloud, software architecture,  writing and whimsy. I currently work for HSBC as a Senior Software Architect in India, Pune.
            </p>

          <h3>My Story </h3>
            <p>
            I did my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (IT) and got campus placement as a Java developer in HSBC Software Development India, Pune. The initial years of my developer experience primarily involved working in the Servlets, JSP and the J2EE stack using MVC frameworks. I was an above average developer and used to get the things done with good quality.I played the role of a defect prevention champion and also enjoyed critical defect fixings of frameworks level defects as well as aged functional defects of the system.
			</p>
			<p>I progressed my career by learning newer technologies like Spring , Spring boot, DustJs & webservices and playing the role of Technical lead.As a Technical Lead my job involved handling my own coding tasks plus solving the problems of the teammates and also coaching them. I was the go to person on the floor on any technical help.Delivered some critical projects in extreme pressure situations which got the best out of me but equally burnt me. Got promoted to Solution Lead role where I was responsible for providing solution for EPICs and work a release ahead of the sprint team.I built
              good experience in performance improvement programs and became an expert on resolving performance issues using Dynatrace tool to analyse high CPU programs which saved considerable $$$ for my organization.
			  
              My keen interest in designing systems and deeper understanding of Modern Architecture patterns naturally progessed taking up Architecture Role.I was leading Architecture stream for 3 teams building Architectural roadmaps in the Scaled Agile Framework.I got multiple opportunity to be an active speaker/participant in organization's Tech events , contributing to Innovation initiatives & conducting many technical sessions for the developer community.
              I wasn't spared from interviewing candidates on Architecture and Leadership roles on weekends and weekdays for critical positions and to set up new teams.I was also lucky to work with some great colleagues who helped me shape my knowledge wherever I lacked depth. I had a great bonding with few of the Enterprise Architects I worked with who helped me hone my communication skills of influencing teams and management.
			</p>
			
<p>After a while, I looked for a change as I was keen to work on Cloud Technologies like AWS, GCP. I self learned AWS and also demonstrated my knowledge by working with a team of fresher graduates by implementing an AWs deployment for a innovative idea which was well received.
  My thirst increased much more and I started reading up Kubernetes.I will strongly recommend "Kubernetes in Action" book to start on your Kubernetes journey. At HSBC, I was leading multiple projects and one of them was migration from PCF to On-Prem Kubernetes. I was excited to perform the POC and eventually used my experience by guiding teams ,taking up knowledge sharing sessions and publishing blogs on Kubernetes.
  As of today, am the SME in the On-boarding & Data domain supporting big clients from Global & Commercial banking.Working as a Lead Architect and contributing in the Reference Architectures, API Standards , API Governance & Digital transformation, Workflow management & Containerization space. I enjoyed my time in working with complex business requirements and providing the right solutions to business.I am currently working on publishing a White Paper on Observability Strategy and excited about it !! </p>

<p>
My recent exploration in Open Telemetry space has got me in to the Observability space.I am helping teams understand how and learn OpenTelemetry. Do read my <a href="#writing">articles on medium !!</a>

            Nitin was a great teammate during our time working together. He asked detailed questions and provided analysis/design solutions during larger product builds.

Nitin was able to collaborate with all teammates regardless of level. He was able to communicate direction and ensure timing was being met. He worked on complex solutions that helped drive revenue for the company. 

I would gladly work with Nitin again in the future and would recommend him in a IT lead and/or Solutions role.

            Nitin has very clear concepts and so it is easy to collaborate with him. He brings in not only what to do , but takes a lot of interest in how to do it and helps team at the ground level. I find his question and thought-process very intuitive and he is quick to lead conversations in right direction so that the problem is solved in right way, with minimum fuss. 
He is well-versed in Java, Design patterns, Architectural styles, Cloud Tech Stack, front end tech-stack , His understanding of working with legacy or modern systems is very good.

            I have worked with Nitin for the past 3 years at the Principal Financial Group. Nitin was playing a Solution Architect role helping 3 of our Pune India scrum teams break down work, solution ideas for implementation, code review, education, understand our core architecture patterns, and be forward thinking and keep our developer staff moving in the right direction. Our business concepts are very complex in the financial services business, especially around investments, fee/expense calculations, discounts, and collection. Nitin was very sharp and could tackle any problems. Nitin's architecture knowledge grew a lot in the 3 years of working with him, especially around REST and Pub/Sub architecture patterns. He has always had great communication with our US and Pune staff and he has grown to be very well respected in our department. Nitin recently announced he is moving to another company and we will miss his leadership, ideas, and fun personality dearly!

            Nitin is a perspective abundant. It's what makes him look at things from multiple aspects and have a good discussion before decision. A very important quality that helps him build answers and solutions at workplace and personally. A very good team member and ready to go a mile to help as he keeps team first. Great to have a colleague like him

      <p>
      When I first started working in tech, I found many concepts difficult to understand. Stack Overflow was still very new back then, and books were often impenetrable.
      </p>
<p>
      Thankfully, things have improved a lot! But a lot of technical documentation can still be frustratingly complex for beginners. It assumes that you already know the tool that you’re trying to learn.
</p><p>
      I decided to share my knowledge and teach everything I know. I try to write clear, simple tutorials about the tools I work with every day. I try to write the kind of tutorials that I’d like to read.
</p>
      So I write to improve my own understanding, to get better at writing, and to give back to the community so that you can understand and get better skills.
